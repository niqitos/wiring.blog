## Development Environment

The ESP32 can be programmed using:

- Arduino IDE
- Espressif IDF (IoT Development Framework)
- Micropython
- JavaScript
- LUA

## Preparing to work with the ESP32 in the Arduino IDE

[Instructions for Windows](2-installing-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-on-windows)

[Instructions for Mac and Linux](3-installing-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-on-mac-os-x-and-linux)

## ESP32 Pinout

The ESP32 has more GPIO pins with more functionality compared to the ESP826. In the program code, you can set the operating mode of the GPIO pins: UART, I2C or SPI. This is possible thanks to the multiplexing function of the ESP32 chip, which allows you to assign several functions to the same pin. If not set in the code, the default pins will be used as shown in the figure below (the pin layout may vary depending on the manufacturer).

30 I/O pin version

36 I/O pin version

## Uploading code to ESP32 via Arduino IDE

Let's look at a simple example of blinking the built-in LED.

Open the Arduino IDE on your computer and copy the following code:

```cpp [esp-32-blinking-led.ino]
// LED on ESP32 is connected to GPIO 23
const int ledPin = 23;

// the setup function is executed once when power is applied or the board is rebooted
void setup () {
  // initialize the digital pin ledPin as an output
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function is executed an infinite number of times in a loop
void loop () {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // apply a high-level digital signal (HIGH) to the ledPin pin, i.e. turn on the LED
  delay(1000); // wait 1 second
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // apply a low-level signal (LOW), i.e. turn off the LED
  delay(1000); // wait 1 second
}
```

This code turns the LED connected to `GPIO 23` on and off at intervals of one second.

## Let's complicate the example

In addition to turning on/off the built-in pin, you can connect an external LED to port `23`.

[**Important!**]{.not-prose.!text-red-500}&#x20;Always check the pinout of your board before connecting.

For this build you will need:

- ESP32 DEVKIT V1 board
- 5mm LED
- 330 Ohm resistor
- Jumpers
- Breadboard (optional)

After connecting all components, connect the ESP32 to the computer and follow the instructions:

1. Go to the **Tools > Board** menu. Find the ESP32 section and select your ESP32 board, for example ESP32 DEVKIT V1.
2. In the **Tools > Port** menu, select the port to which the ESP32 is connected. If you are not sure of the port name, disconnect the board and check which port has disappeared from the list.
3. Click `Upload`.

## Demo

After uploading the code, the onboard LED connected to `GPIO 23` will blink at 1 second intervals.

## Possible errors

*Failed to connect to ESP32: Timed out... Connecting...*

First of all, make sure that the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE settings.

If the error persists, it means that your ESP32 board is not in flashing/uploading mode. To upload code in this situation, follow these steps:

- Press and hold the `BOOT` button on the ESP32 board
- After you see the **Connectingâ€¦.** message in the Arduino IDE console, release your finger from the `BOOT` button:
- After that, you should see the **Done uploading** message.

After uploading the sketch, press the `ENABLE` button to reboot the ESP32.

## In conclusion

Blinking an LED is a simple project that will help you get started with your ESP32 and learn how to upload firmware to the board.
