  title: Pinout
---

The ESP32 chip has 48 multi-functional pins. Not all pins are available on all ESP32 development boards, and some pins cannot be used.

The image below shows the pinout of the ESP-WROOM-32 chip. You can use it as a reference if you are using a bare ESP32 chip to build your own board:

Not all GPIOs are available on all development boards, but each specific GPIO works the same regardless of the development board you are using. If you are just starting out with the ESP32, we recommend reading our guide: Getting Started with the ESP32 Development Board.

## ESP32 Peripherals

- 18 channels of analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
- 3 SPI interfaces
- 3 UART interfaces
- 2 I2C interfaces
- 16 PWM output channels
- 2 digital-to-analog converters (DAC)
- 2 I2S interfaces
- 10 capacitive GPIO sensors

The ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) functions are assigned to specific static pins. However, in the program code, you can assign which pins as UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, etc. This is possible thanks to the multiplexing function of the ESP32 chip.

While you can define pin properties in software, there are pins that are assigned by default, as shown in the following image (this is an example of an ESP32 DEVKIT V1 DOIT board with 36 pins - pin layouts may vary by manufacturer).

In addition, there are pins with specific functions that make them suitable or unsuitable for a particular project. The following table shows which pins are best used as inputs, outputs, and which ones to be careful with.

Pins highlighted in green are fine to use. Those highlighted in yellow are fine to use, but should be watched carefully as they may have unexpected behavior, mainly during boot. Pins highlighted in red are not recommended for use as inputs or outputs.

## Input pins

GPIOs 34–39 are GPI — that is, they only work in input mode, since they do not have a pull-up resistor.

- GPIO 34
- GPIO 35
- GPIO 36
- GPIO 39

## SPI flash on ESP-WROOM-32

GPIOs 6–11 have pins on some ESP32 development boards, but these pins are connected to the built-in SPI flash module on the ESP-WROOM-32 chip and are not recommended for other purposes.

- GPIO 6 (SCK/CLK)
- GPIO 7 (SDO/SD0)
- GPIO 8 (SDI/SD1)
- GPIO 9 (SHD/SD2)
- GPIO 10 (SWP/SD3)
- GPIO 11 (CSC/CMD)

## Capacitive Touch GPIOs

The ESP32 is equipped with 10 capacitive touch sensors. These sensors can sense changes in anything that has an electrical charge, such as human skin. This means they can detect changes when you touch the GPIO pins with your finger. These pins can be easily integrated into capacitive pads and replace mechanical buttons. The capacitive touch pins can also be used to wake the ESP32 from deep sleep mode.
These internal touch sensors are connected to these GPIO pins:

- T0 (GPIO 4)
- T1 (GPIO 0)
- T2 (GPIO 2)
- T3 (GPIO 15)
- T4 (GPIO 13)
- T5 (GPIO 12)
- T6 (GPIO 14)
- T7 (GPIO 27)
- T8 (GPIO 33)
- T9 (GPIO 32)

## Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

The ESP32 has 18 12-bit ADC input channels (whereas the ESP8266 only has 1 10-bit ADC). The GPIOs that can be used as ADCs are listed below, and their corresponding relevant channels:

- ADC1\_CH0 (GPIO 36)
- ADC1\_CH1 (GPIO 37)
- ADC1\_CH2 (GPIO 38)
- ADC1\_CH3 (GPIO 39)
- ADC1\_CH4 (GPIO 32)
- ADC1\_CH5 (GPIO 33)
- ADC1\_CH6 (GPIO 34)
- ADC1\_CH7 (GPIO 35)
- ADC2\_CH0 (GPIO 4)
- ADC2\_CH1 (GPIO 0)
- ADC2\_CH2 (GPIO 2)
- ADC2\_CH3 (GPIO 15)
- ADC2\_CH4 (GPIO 13)
- ADC2\_CH5 (GPIO 12)
- ADC2\_CH6 (GPIO 14)
- ADC2\_CH7 (GPIO 27)
- ADC2\_CH8 (GPIO 25)
- ADC2\_CH9 (GPIO 26)

Note: ADC2 pins cannot be used when using WiFi. So if you are using WiFi and have problems getting a value from the ADC2 GPIO output, try using the ADC1 GPIO output instead - this should solve the problem.

The ADC input channels have 12-bit resolution. This means that you can get analog readings in the range from 0 to 4095, where 0 corresponds to 0 V and 4095 corresponds to 3.3 V. You can also set the channel resolution in code, as well as the ADC range.

The ESP32 ADC pins do not have a linear behavior. You probably won't be able to tell the difference between 0 and 0.1 V or 3.2 and 3.3 V. This is something to keep in mind when using the ADC pins. You'll get behavior similar to the following image.

## Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)

The ESP32 has two 8-bit DAC channels for converting digital signals into analog voltage output signals. The DAC channels are:

- DAC1 (GPIO25)
- DAC2 (GPIO26)

## RTC GPIOs

The ESP32 supports RTC GPIOs. The GPIOs connected to the low-power RTC subsystem can be used when the ESP32 is in deep sleep mode. These RTC GPIOs can be used to wake the ESP32 from deep sleep mode when the ultra-low power (ULP) coprocessor is running. The following GPIO pins can be used as an external wake-up source:

- RTC\_GPIO0 (GPIO36)
- RTC\_GPIO3 (GPIO39)
- RTC\_GPIO4 (GPIO34)
- RTC\_GPIO5 (GPIO35)
- RTC\_GPIO6 (GPIO25)
- RTC\_GPIO7 (GPIO26)
- RTC\_GPIO8 (GPIO33)
- RTC\_GPIO9 (GPIO32)
- RTC\_GPIO10 (GPIO4)
- RTC\_GPIO11 (GPIO0)
- RTC\_GPIO12 (GPIO2)
- RTC\_GPIO13 (GPIO15)
- RTC\_GPIO14 (GPIO13)
- RTC\_GPIO15 (GPIO12)
- RTC\_GPIO16 (GPIO14)
- RTC\_GPIO17 (GPIO27)

## Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

The ESP32 PWM LED controller has 16 independent channels that can be configured to generate PWM signals with different characteristics. All pins that can work as outputs can be used as PWM outputs (GPIO pins 34 to 39 do not support PWM generation).

To set up a PWM signal, you need to define the following parameters in the code:

- Signal frequency;
- Duty cycle;
- PWM channel;
- GPIO port you want to send the signal to.

## I2C

When using the ESP32 with the Arduino IDE, you should use the standard ESP32 I2C pins (supported by the Wire library):

- GPIO 21 (SDA)
- GPIO 22 (SCL)

## Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

The default pin assignments for SPI are as follows:

| **SPI**  | **MOSI** | **MISO** | **CLK** | **CS**  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| **VSPI** | GPIO 23  | GPIO 19  | GPIO 18 | GPIO 5  |
| **HSPI** | GPIO 13  | GPIO 12  | GPIO 14 | GPIO 15 |

# UART

The ESP32 supports up to three UART interfaces: UART0, UART1, and UART2, depending on the ESP32 board model you are using.

The UART0 port is typically reserved for communicating with the serial monitor during upload and debugging. However, it can also be used to communicate with other devices after the code has been uploaded, if the serial monitor is not needed.
UART1 and UART2: Available for communicating with external devices.
Like I2C and SPI, these UART pins can be mapped to any GPIO pin on the ESP32. However, on most board models, they have a standard pin assignment.
For most ESP32 boards, the UART pin assignments are as follows:

\| UART Port | TX | RX | Remarks |
\| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
\| UART0 | GPIO 1 | GPIO 3 | Used for Serial Monitor and uploading code; Can be assigned to other GPIOs; |
\| UART1 | GPIO 10 | GPIO 9 | Must be assigned to other GPIOs |
\| UART2 | GPIO 17 | GPIO 16 | Can be assigned to other GPIOs |

As for UART1 (GPIO 9 and GPIO10), these GPIO pins are connected to the ESP32 SPI flash memory, so they cannot be used in this way. To use UART1 to communicate with other devices, you need to define other pins using the HardwareSerial library.

## Interrupts

All GPIOs can be configured as interrupts.

## Communication Pins

The ESP32 chip has the following communication pins:

- GPIO 0
- GPIO 2
- GPIO 4
- GPIO 5
- GPIO 12
- GPIO 15

These are used to put the ESP32 into bootloader or flash mode. On most development boards with built-in USB/serial, you don't need to worry about the state of these pins. The board automatically puts the pins into the state The pins are required to flash or upload a file. You can learn more about selecting the ESP32 boot mode here.
However, if you have peripherals connected to these pins, you may have problems uploading new code, flashing the ESP32, or resetting the board. If you have peripherals connected to these pins and you have problems uploading code or flashing the ESP32, it is possible that these peripherals are preventing the ESP32 from entering the correct mode. Please refer to the documentation on selecting the boot mode to learn how to do this. After a reset, flashing, or booting, these pins work as expected.

## Pins are HIGH on boot

Some GPIOs go HIGH or output PWM signals when booting or resetting. This means that if you have outputs connected to these GPIOs, you may get unexpected results when resetting or booting the ESP32.

- GPIO 1
- GPIO 3
- GPIO 5
- GPIO 6–GPIO 11 (connected to the ESP32 integrated SPI flash memory – not recommended).
- GPIO 14
- GPIO 15

## Enable (EN)

The Enable (EN) pin is the enable pin for the 3.3V voltage regulator. It is pulled up, so it should be connected to ground to disable the 3.3V voltage regulator. This means you can use this pin by connecting it to a button, for example to reset the ESP32.

## GPIO Current Draw

The absolute maximum current draw of each GPIO is 40mA, as per the Recommended Operating Conditions section of the ESP32 datasheet.

## ESP32 Built-in Hall Sensor

The ESP32 also has a built-in Hall sensor that detects changes in the magnetic field around it.
