## Install Arduino IDE

You can download the installer from the official website [arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Install ESP32

To install the ESP32 board in Arduino IDE, follow these steps:

1. Open the settings window in Arduino IDE by going to **File > Settings**
2. In the `Additional Board Manager URLs` field, enter the following:

```text
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
```

3. Click `OK`:

If you already have the URL of the ESP8266 boards, you can specify them separated by commas: `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json, http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`

4. Open the board manager by going to **Tools > Board > Board Managerâ€¦**
5. In the search bar, type ESP32 and click `Install` next to **ESP32 by Espressif Systems**
6. Done. Installation will take a few seconds.

## Configuration

Connect the ESP32 board to your computer and follow these steps:

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Select your board in **Tools > Board** (in my case it's the ESP32 DEVKIT V1 board)
3. Select the port. If you don't see the COM port in Arduino IDE, you need to install the `ESP32 CP210x USB` to `UART Bridge VCP Drivers`:
4. Open the following example in **File > Examples > WiFiScan**.
5. A new sketch will open:
6. Press `Upload` in Arduino IDE. Wait a few seconds for the code to compile and upload to the board.
7. If all is well, you should see the message **Done uploading**
8. Open Arduino IDE serial monitor and set the baud rate to `115200`:
9. Press `EN` on the ESP32 board and you will see the networks available near your ESP32:

## In conclusion

This is a simple guide that illustrates how to prepare your Arduino IDE to work with the ESP32 on a Windows PC.
