## Install ESP32

To install the ESP32 board in Arduino IDE, follow these steps:

1. Open the settings window in Arduino IDE by going to `Arduino IDE` :chevron-right `Preferences`

::u-color-mode-image
---
light: "/images/esp32/3/en/light-file.webp"
dark: "/images/esp32/3/en/dark-file.webp"
alt: "File"
---
::

2. In the `Additional Board Manager URLs` field, enter this config file URL:

```text
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
```

::u-color-mode-image

light: "/images/esp32/3/en/light-preferences.webp"
dark: "/images/esp32/3/en/dark-preferences.webp"
alt: "Preferences"
---
::

::tip
If you already have the URL of the ESP8266 boards, you can specify multiple files URLs separated by comma:
```html
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json, http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
```
::

3. Click `OK`:

4. Open the board manager by going to `Tools` :chevron-right `Board` :chevron-right `Boards Managerâ€¦`

::u-color-mode-image
---
light: "/images/esp32/3/en/light-board-manager.webp"
dark: "/images/esp32/3/en/dark-board-manager.webp"
alt: "Board manager"
---
::

5. In the search bar, type **ESP32** and click `Install` next to **ESP32 by Espressif Systems**

::u-color-mode-image

6. Done. Installation will take a few seconds.

## Configuration

Connect the ESP32 board to your computer and follow these steps:

1. In Arduino IDE select your board in `Tools` :chevron-right `Board` (in my case it's the ESP32 DEVKIT V1 board)
2. In `Tools` :chevron-right `Board` select the port. If you don't see the COM port in Arduino IDE, you need to install the `ESP32 CP210x USB` to `UART Bridge VCP Drivers`:
3. Open the following example in `File` :chevron-right `Examples` :chevron-right `WiFi` :chevron-right `WiFiScan`.
4. A new sketch will open:
5. Press `Upload` in Arduino IDE. Wait a few seconds for the code to compile and upload to the board.
6. If all is well, you should see the message **Done uploading**
7. Open Arduino IDE serial monitor and set the baud rate to `115200`:
8. Press `EN` on the ESP32 board and you will see the networks available near your ESP32:

## In conclusion

This is a simple guide that illustrates how to prepare your Arduino IDE to work with the ESP32 on a Windows PC.
